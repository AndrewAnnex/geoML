# geoML
Spatial modeling using machine learning concepts.

This is a work in progress. Current functionality includes:

* Gaussian Process modeling in 1D, 2D, and 3D, with 
anisotropy ellipsoid;
* Support for directional data (structural geology
measurements, scalar field gradients, etc.);
* Support for classification with boundary data (points
lying in the boundary between two rock types);
* Limited 3D plotting with plotly;
* Back-end powered by TensorFlow and a genetic algorithm;
* **NEW**: support for a larger number of data points with
block circulant covariance matrices.

See the notebooks for some examples.
