## version 0.1.2
* Introduced the `jitter` parameter in the models, for improved 
numerical stability.
* Corrected a bug where setting the value of a parameter beyond its limits
would not extend the limits.
* Implemented the `prod_n()` and `safe_logdet()` functions in the 
`tftools` module.
* Implemented the `aggregate_categorical()` method for point data methods.
* Optimized the batch prediction process.
* Implemented saving and loading for model parameters.
* Implemented the neural network transform.
* Now multiple transforms can be chained and/or shared between multiple
kernels.

## version 0.1.1
* Added support for products of kernels.
* Fixed bug in `geoml.tftools.prod_n()` function.
* `geoml.kernels.GaussianKernel.covariance_matrix(x, y)` now
adds some jitter to the covariance matrix when x == y, to
avoid Cholesky decomposition problems.
* `geoml.warping.Softplus` now corrects non-positive values
in its input.
* Corrected a bug where the wrong nugget would be added
while making a prediction.
* Added sunspot number data and example notebook.
* Implemented cubic convolution fully in TensorFlow.
* Set the default `n_knots=5` in `geoml.warping.Spline.__init__()`.
